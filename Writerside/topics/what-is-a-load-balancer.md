# What is a load balancer

## Overview

First off, what is a load balancer? A load balancer is a network device or software application that distributes
incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers. It operates based on certain algorithms and rules to
ensure optimal resource utilisation, maximise throughput, and minimise response time.
Imagine a busy restaurant with several waiters. The role of the load balancer is similar to that of a head-waiter who
assigns customers to various waiters, ensuring that no single waiter is overwhelmed while others are idle. The
head-waiter makes sure customers are served efficiently, improving overall service and experience. Just like the
head-waiter, the load balancer directs incoming user requests to multiple servers in a way that balances the load
effectively.

## When do you need a load balancer?

You need to add a load balancer to your enterprise in several situations when you want to improve the performance,
availability, and scalability of your application or service. Here are some common scenarios where load balancers are
essential:

**High Availability (HA) and Redundancy:** Load balancers can be configured with multiple backend servers. In case one
server fails, the load balancer can redirect traffic to healthy servers, ensuring high availability and minimising
downtime.

**Fault Tolerance:** Load balancers can monitor the health of servers and automatically take faulty or unresponsive servers
out of the rotation, ensuring that only healthy servers handle incoming requests.

**High Traffic Websites:** If your website experiences high traffic and concurrent user requests, a load balancer helps
evenly distribute the workload across multiple web servers. This prevents any single server from being overwhelmed and
ensures smooth and responsive user experiences.

**Application Scaling:** As your user base grows or your application demands increase, you may need to add more servers or
resources to handle the load. A load balancer ensures that these new resources are utilised efficiently and that the
workload is balanced across them.

**Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** CDNs use load balancers to distribute content across multiple servers in different
locations. This minimises latency and improves the delivery speed of content to users around the world.

**Scalability and Elasticity:** Load balancers facilitate horizontal scaling, where you can add or remove servers
dynamically based on demand. This enables your system to handle traffic spikes and maintain performance during peak
loads.

**Application Performance:** Load balancers can optimise the use of server resources and ensure that each server operates
within its capacity, avoiding performance bottlenecks.

**SSL Termination:** If your application requires SSL/TLS encryption, a load balancer can offload the SSL termination
process from backend servers, reducing their computational overhead.
Handling Different Protocols and Services: Load balancers can distribute requests across different types of servers or
services, making it possible to consolidate multiple applications behind a single entry point.
