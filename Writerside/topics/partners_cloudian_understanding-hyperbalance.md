# Understanding HyperBalance

## Overview

Load balancers are a core component of any IT infrastructure but they are particularly beneficial when it comes to S3
Object storage solutions. Load balancing a HyperStore Cluster provides additional resilience and redundancy. Possibly
the greatest benefit of load balancing a HyperStore cluster is evening out the distribution of traffic. Sending new
connections to the HyperStore nodes with the least active connections flattens the distribution of objects across the
cluster.

This document aims to give you an understanding of HyperBalance and how to determine which HyperBalance appliance is
appropriate for an environment.
